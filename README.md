This AI-powered Resume Screening Tool is an intelligent web application designed to automate and optimize the candidate shortlisting process. It analyzes resumes in PDF and DOCX formats, extracts relevant candidate information such as name, email, phone number, and skills, and compares them against a given job description using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. By leveraging TF-IDF and cosine similarity with a weighted skill-matching approach, the system calculates an accurate matching percentage, identifies matched and missing skills, and ranks candidates accordingly. Built with Python and Streamlit, the tool provides a clean, interactive interface and is fully deployable on the cloud, making it suitable for recruiters, HR teams, placement cells, and AI-based hiring automation use cases.
